Network Measurement and Accounting Meter (NetMate)

REQUIREMENTS

NetMate has been successfully compiled on ix86/Linux 2.4/2.6, ix86/FreeBSD 4
and Sparc/Solaris 8.

The following libraries are required:

readline
libpcap (http://www.tcpdump.org) 
libxml2 and libxslt (http://xmlsoft.org)
libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se)

The following may be required depending on the build configuration:

openssl (http://www.openssl.org)
pthreads (OS dependent)

libxslt and libcurl are only required for the interactive remote shell
meter control tool (called nmrsh) and not for the meter itself.

INSTALLATION

A normal Unix installation is made in three steps (after you've
unpacked the source archive):

        ./configure
        make
        make install

You probably need to be root when doing the last command.

If you have checked out the sources from the CVS repository, read the
CVS-INFO on how to proceed.

Get a full listing of all available configure options by invoking it like:

       ./configure --help

If you want to install netmate in a different file hierarchy than /usr/local,
you need to specify that already when running configure:

        ./configure --prefix=/path/to/netmate/tree

If you happen to have write permission in that directory, you can do 'make
install' without being root. An example of this would be to make a local
install in your own home directory:

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME
        make
        make install

By default netmate will be compiled without SSL and thread support. SSL
can be enabled:

        ./configure --enable-ssl

If you have OpenSSL installed in the default search
path for your compiler/linker, you don't need to do anything special. 
If you have OpenSSL installed somewhere else (for example, /opt/OpenSSL,)
you can run configure like this:

        ./configure --with-ssl=/opt/OpenSSL

Thread support requires a functional pthread library and can be enabled:

        ./configure --enable-threads


If you have OpenSSL installed, but with the libraries in one place and the
header files somewhere else, you have to set the LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS
environment variables prior to running configure.  Something like this
should work:

     (with the Bourne shell and its clones):

       CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/ssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/ssl/lib" \
           ./configure

     (with csh, tcsh and their clones):

       env CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/ssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/ssl/lib" \
       ./configure

If your SSL library was compiled with rsaref (usually for use in the United
States), you may also need to set:

     LIBS=-lRSAglue -lrsaref

If you want want to compile netmate for debugging use:

     ./configure --enable-debug
