Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Q: Where does "make install" put the files by default?

A: By default netmate is installed in the /usr/local tree:
   /usr/local/bin            holds the generated executables,
   /usr/local/etc/netmate    holds the netmate configuration,
   /usr/local/lib/netmate    holds all plug-in modules.


Q: How can I install netmate to a different directory?

A: Call ./configure with the option --prefix=<install_dir>


Q: When I start netmate I get the error message
   "Terminating netmate on error: cannot open pidfile '/var/run/netmate.pid' \
    for writing: Permission denied". What is wrong?

A: You will need to run netmate as user 'root'. This is usually required to 
   capture packets from the network interface card and also for writing in 
   /var/run/

   You can also configure netmate so that pid file and log file will be
   created in different directories (where you have write permissions). If
   the interface is readable for you or you do not capture from an interface
   (e.g. input from a tcpdump file) you do not need to have root permissions.
