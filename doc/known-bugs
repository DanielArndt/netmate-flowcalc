Known bugs & problems
---------------------

duplicate httpd access log entries when remote config is used 
(sometimes)

memory leak in nmrsh/readline (constant 40 byte), readline bug?
memory leak in crypto lib!? (happens only when remote config
via SSL is used)

C++ memory optimization leads to still reachable blocks after
program exit; C++ memory optimization can be disabled with
seeting GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW environment variable (not a bug)

netmate sometimes does not properly terminate when running 
multithreaded

when using netmate on trace files the export timestamp in the
exported data files is the current time but not based on the
trace
