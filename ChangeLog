Version 0.9.5 (released 10/09/2009)
- fixed deprecated c++ library includes
- fixed bug in flow creator eqKey function when comparing keys with
  different length (actually this bug would *never* occur since there is
  one flow creator per rule and the keys are always of equal length)
- added virtual destructor for stats classes in NetTap and Classsifier
  classes
- added a mechanism to have different Makefiles in release version
- updated obsolete properties in rpm spec files
- added support for DLT_NULL in NetTapPcap
- fix nmrsh help output

Version 0.9.4 (released 05/07/2006)
- improve command line parameter handling and usage output
  (including fixing one incorrect long option name)
- fixed the doxygen test in configure.in
- fixed a bug in nmrsh that caused the sending of wrong meter commands
  to netmate 
- some internal changes to make gcc 4 happy (hash_map moved etc.)

Version 0.9.3 (released 07/12/2005)
- can read mutiple trace files if specified on the command line
  as comma separated list
- flow record status (0=interim, 1=final) is now optionally exported
  put an <PREF NAME="ExportStatus">yes</PREF> in the export configuration
- now exits and prints pcap error if pcap_dispatch fails
- fixed ctext_file module name in debug output of module
- enabled large file support for export modules
- fixed bug in handling flow timeout which occured if a trace files
  contains data from a single source destination pair
- fixed BINARY output (e.g. MAC addresses) in all export modules
- fixed variance computation in jitter module
- fixed module loading (recent libtool generates .so files again)
- fixed a bug in packet processor that caused a packet to be assigned 
  to the forward direction also it is in fact backward; this problem
  only occured with the hack that swaps flow directions if the first
  packet comes from a port<1024 and goes to a port>1024

Version 0.9.2 (released 01/06/2005)
- fixed missing # in nmctl copyright
- fixes to make netmate compile with gcc 3.4
- flow ids are now "unique" and optionally exported to files
  (flow ids are 2^64 bit so eventually they wrap around)
  put an <PREF NAME="FlowID">yes</PREF> in the export configuration
- fixed a bug hich caused all export data to be ouput twice, which
  occured if reading tracefiles and specifying interval or stop
  time in the rule set
- rule data will now always exported when rule expires or is terminated
  through ctrlcomm 
- changed realm name shown in the username/password browser dialog to 
  "NetMate" 
- fixed c_str() coversion bugs in ctrlcomm messages (ends inserts a \0 
  for ostringstream :( )
- the password callback option has been removed from libcurl 7.11.
  therefore we can't use it any longer. the getpass function from
  libcurl has been included as lib to provide the same functionality.

Version 0.9.1 (internal release)
- enabled bidirectional matching for MAC addresses
- fixed a bug that prevented rule data export upon meter termination
  when export interval was not set (mostly relevant when using capture
  files)

Version 0.9 (released 02/12/2004)
- fixed export of string/binary flow keys
- fixed bug where the filter definition mask wasn't applied to the 
  flowkeys
- added automatic termination of the meter when reading tcpdump files
  after reaching the end of the file
- added data export when the meter terminates (EOF or CTRL-C)
- fixed bug in exporter for binary data types which resulted in div/0
- byte-sized flowkeys (such as IP version) are exported shifted
  downwards if their mask only uses higher order bits of the byte
- added support for VLAN (802.1Q) ether type
- fixed host byte order conversion for 16 and 32 bit flow key values
- replaced deprecated strstream by sstream
- fixed a bug in flow key to host byte order conversion which produced
  error when multiple export modules where used in the same rule
- added support for ATM RFC1483 link layer
- added better trace file support; now this tracefiles for all event 
  handling instead of the wallclock time the time from the tracfile
  is used (as stored in the pcap packet headers). this allows the
  proper use of rule start, stop, duration and flow timeout.
- optimized some internal data structures
- fixed a bug where auto flows starting with a reverse matched packet
  (according to the classifier) where incorrectly handled
- when auto flows are used now the rule filters appear in the output
  file in exactly the same order as specified in the rule (previously
  they were alphabetically sorted) 
- added new data export modules (compressed text, IPFIX)
- added support to read packet traces from Endance Record Format files
- added support for using raw IP (no link level headers) as input
- fixed a bug when reading from a packet savefile, in this 
  case filter rules must be installed before the net tap is active
- fixed compilation under FreeBSD when threads are enabled

Version 0.8 (released 02/05/2004)
- added multiple interface support (netmate -i eth0,eth1 works)
- added automatic flow creation: this feature allows an automatic
  flow detection within a rule (all packet processing modules are
  applied on each flow)
- changed the interface through which export modules access the
  metric data
- the text_file module does no longer delete files anymore when 
  new rules are started
- text_file module now creates new directories if necessary
- changed rule parsing functions so that there are not DNS queries   
  anymore for numeric IP adresses used in rulesets
- fixed a bug in configure.in which caused wrong default paths to
  be set in config.h when configure was started with --prefix
- change build logic so that if libxslt or libcurl are not found
  nmrsh won't be build
- added check for termcap in configure.in otherwise the readline
  check fails (on Redhat)
- added check for curl_free in configure.in (old curl version do
  not have that function)
- fixed warning which occur when creating documentation with new
  doxygen 1.3.2
- fixed set socket buffer size in NetTapPcap (now also works if
  socket is blocking)
- fixed a bug in debugging code of ClassifierRFC
- fixed a memory leak which occured when parsing IP adresses
  after a DNS timeout
- fixed a bug in the internal rule id usage
- fixed a bug which prevented make dist with VPATH

Version 0.7 (internal release)
- netmate initial beta release version 0.7
