# Introduction #

From the NetMate website:

> NETMATE (Network Measurement and Accounting System) is a flexible and extensible network measurement tool (meter). It can be used for accounting, delay/loss measurement, packet capturing and much more. The main advantage over other existing tools is that it can be easily extended due to its modular (class-based) structure and dynamic loadable packet processing and information export modules. A GUI for controlling multiple meters and displaying measurement results is currently under development.
