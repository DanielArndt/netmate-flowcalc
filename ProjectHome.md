This project is mainly aimed at providing a full package for calculating flow statistics for network traffic analysis based off the two projects [NetMate](NetMate.md) and [NetAI](NetAI.md).

I'm working on some enhancements as well as including parts of [NetAI](NetAI.md) in the [NetMate](NetMate.md) package. This is in no way meant to be a fork of the original [NetMate](NetMate.md) or [NetAI](NetAI.md) projects which may or may not still be under development. This project will be used to track changes I've made and host the changes somewhere central. Worthy changes will be submitted to the developers.

Download one of the (hopefully working) snapshots in the Downloads section.

From there, look at the README or try [this guide](http://web.cs.dal.ca/~darndt/nims/calculating-flow-statistics-using-netmate/). If you run into any problems please submit an issue. After that, if you need things working right away you can try
